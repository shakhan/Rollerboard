This is a simple MOTD (message of the day) app at the moment; showing last 10 messages 
entered via the textbox. Streehoarding served as the base.

NOTE: Most of the stuff here is filched from streehoarding & skeet
      So, I am not gonna pretend it's original. In fact, this is a
      shameless clone which serves as a workshop where I sharpen
      my toolset. Even the setup instructions below are mostly copied 
      as-is. Depending on the time of the day, there would be
      a version here, which for all intents and purposes might not
      be what you are looking for; but heck, what do I care. Thanks
      for dropping by anyway.
