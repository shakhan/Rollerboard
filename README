As of today 26th March, 10.30 PM (All times are in IST); uses:-
1) node.js
2) jQuery
3) redis
4) mustache

NOTE: Most of the stuff here is filched from streehoarding & skeet
      So, I am not gonna pretend it's original. In fact, this is a
      shameless clone which serves as a workshop where I sharpen
      my toolset. Depending on the time of the day, there would be
      a version here, which for all intents and purposes might not
      be what you are looking for; but heck, what do I care. Thanks
      for dropping by anyway.

==========================================
This is a simple MOTD app at the moment; showing last 10 messages entered via the textbox.
Streehoarding served as the base.

=============================================
Yay! Incorporated mustache such that each displayed MOTD is displayed 
via a mustache template. On same lines as skeet.
